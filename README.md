# Financial Distress
Financial distress of a company refers to a situation where the firm is facing significant difficulties in meeting its financial obligations and maintaining its operations due to an inability to generate sufficient cash flow or access necessary funds. It is a state of financial instability that may indicate the company is at risk of defaulting on its debts, facing bankruptcy, or experiencing a severe decline in its financial performance.

# Insights from the model 
The top 10 most important features for predicting the chances of bankruptcy of a company are as follows:-
(1) Profit on (operating activities / financial expences)
(2) Profit on sales
(3) Profit on (Operating Activities / sales)
(4) (Gross profit+ depreciation) / sales
(5) (Retained earnings / total assets)
(6) (total liability / (profit on operating activities + depreciation)* (12/365))
(7) (total liabilities * 365) / (gross profit + depreciation)
(8) Working Capital
(9) (net profit / total assets)
(10) (EBIT /total assets)

# Some potential benefits of my model are as follows :- 
(1) Early Warning System: By analyzing financial data, it will identify early signs of financial distress, allowing the company to take proactive measures to prevent bankruptcy. Timely interventions can help address underlying issues and improve financial stability.

(2) Risk Assessment and Mitigation: Will assist the company in evaluating the risk associated with potential clients, suppliers, or business partners. Before engaging in significant financial transactions, the company can use the model to assess the likelihood of the counterparty facing bankruptcy, reducing the risk of losses due to default.

(3) Financial Decision Making: Could guide financial decision-making processes within the company. 

(4) Investment and M&A Analysis: When evaluating potential investment opportunities or considering mergers and acquisitions, my model can be employed to assess the financial health of the target company. This information can aid in making well-informed investment decisions.

(5) Resource Allocation: Companies can use the predictions to optimize resource allocation. By identifying financially distressed business units or subsidiaries, they can allocate resources more efficiently, focus on turnaround efforts, or even consider divestiture options if necessary.

(6) Improving Internal Processes: Analyzing past financial data and identifying contributing factors to bankruptcy predictions can reveal areas of inefficiency or financial mismanagement within the organization.

(7) Stakeholder Confidence: Can instill confidence in stakeholders, including investors, lenders, and customers. The company can showcase its commitment to financial stability and risk management, which can positively impact its reputation and relationships.

(8) Compliance and Reporting: For companies operating in highly regulated industries, my model will aid in compliance efforts. It will assist in fulfilling reporting requirements and ensure compliance with financial regulations.

(9) Long-term Financial Planning: It can assist in identifying potential financial risks, helping the company develop strategies to mitigate those risks and enhance overall financial performance.

(10) Benchmarking: Companies can use the model to compare their own financial health and bankruptcy risk against industry peers. This benchmarking can provide valuable insights into their position within the market and highlight areas that require attention.
